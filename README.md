# CustomKart

> WPF program to easily create Mario Kart DS ROM hacks

## Status

CustomKart (CKart) is a project, using four very well known DS hacking programs (**MKDS Course Modifier**, **Every File Explorer**, **DS Sound Studio** and **NSMB Editor**) as libraries, whose aim is to make Mario Kart DS ROM hacking as simple as possible.

The project isn't finished. However, several options and menus work fine. Compile and use it at your own risk!
